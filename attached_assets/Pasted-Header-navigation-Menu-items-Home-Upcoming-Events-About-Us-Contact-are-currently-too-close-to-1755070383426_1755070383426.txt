Header navigation:

Menu items (Home, Upcoming Events, About Us, Contact) are currently too close to the left.

Center them in the header or place them in the most visually appealing way according to your design sense.

Footer navigation and copyright:

Links like Rules, About Us, Contact currently do not navigate to any page. Fix this so each link works properly.

Add a proper copyright section with the year 1404 and a neat, professional text.

Upcoming Events:

Currently, all events appear as already held, and there is no Register button.

Update event dates to start from Shahrivar 1404 (early September 2025).

Include a functional Register button for each event so users can sign up directly.

After registration, display the number of people registered and show a success message.

Make sure events are actually “upcoming” and not misleading.

Increase the number of events: at least 8 events should be displayed.

Add events based on the images I provide; for each image, create a corresponding event with information.

Replace any placeholder images of a person (like the current male icon) with book-related images.

User Clubs:

Create a section where users can see the clubs they have joined.

For café owners, allow them to create new clubs, add a book, and specify details for their new club.

Pages not working:

Fix About Us, Contact, Login, and Register pages so they are fully functional and accessible from the header or footer.

Search Features:

Include a book search functionality.

Include a location search by district for the 22 districts of Tehran.

Display cafés where an event will take place on a selected date, including their district.

If multiple cafés have the same name in a district, display all of them.

User Profiles:

When users log in or sign up, show their user profile page.

Display their activities, such as events they joined and clubs they participated in.

General improvements:

Improve UI/UX design and color scheme; select a suitable warm café color palette.

The site must be fully responsive.

Use proper Persian fonts (e.g., Vazirmatn, Estedad) and maintain RTL layout.

Include form validation for registration.

Use React Router for navigation between pages.

Backend API must be fully implemented, handling event management, registration, clubs, search, and user profiles.

Add a site icon (favicon) for the website.

Please first provide a mockup or design preview showing all these fixes and improvements. After I approve the design, generate the full React code and complete backend API with all these features, corrections, and the events based on the images I provide.

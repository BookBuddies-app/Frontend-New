 Header navigation:
Menu items About Us, Contact, Login, and Register are currently inactive. Clicking them does not navigate to the corresponding page.

Make sure all these links are fully functional and users are redirected to the appropriate pages.

2. Home page and About Us section:
The “Learn More About Us” link is currently inactive and does not navigate to the About Us page.

Activate this link so users can access the About Us page.

3. Event registration and rules:
In the event registration section, the Rules and Regulations button is inactive and does not navigate to the rules page.

Because of this, the event registration button does not appear afterwards.

Fix these buttons so users can view the rules and then register for the event.

4. Footer:
Footer links About Us, Rules, and Contact Us are inactive and do not navigate to their pages.

Activate all footer links so users can access the corresponding pages.

5. User profiles and “My Clubs”:
After login or registration, each user must have a Profile Page.

The My Clubs section should be active and display all clubs the user has joined.

Users should be able to see their activities, such as events they have attended and clubs they are members of.

6. Search and advanced features:
Add book search functionality.

Add location search by Tehran’s 22 districts, displaying cafés related to upcoming events.

If multiple cafés have the same name in a district, show all of them.

7. Creating new clubs for café owners:
Café owners should be able to create new clubs.

When creating a club, they can add information about the book, including conditions and details, and save it to the system.

8. General improvements and emphasis:
The site must be fully responsive.

Use appropriate Persian fonts (e.g., Vazirmatn, Estedad) and maintain RTL layout.

Header and footer navigation should be neat and user-friendly.

All pages (Home, Events, About Us, Contact, Rules, Login, Register) must be fully functional and accessible via React Router.

The backend API should be fully implemented, handling event management, registration, clubs, search, and user profiles.

Event registration and rules buttons must work correctly.

Add a site icon (favicon) for the website.

Please first provide a mockup or design preview showing all these fixes and improvements. After I approve it, generate the full React code and completed backend API with all these features and corrections.
